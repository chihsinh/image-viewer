## Image Viewer
**An assignment of Web Programming, a course by Professor Ric Huang in NTU.** The file 'images', and styles.css are provided by the Professor Huang and the TAs of Web Programming in NTU.

### How it Works
Users can browse different pictures by clicking the "previous" and "next" buttons. As shown below.

When users reach the last picture, the "next" button is disabled. Likewise, the "previous" button is disabled at the first picture.

A loading gif shows if images do not load immediately.
